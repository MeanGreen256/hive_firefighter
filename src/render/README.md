# src/render

Three.js and React Three Fiber. Reads simulation state, draws it.

## The rule

No hardcoded colour literals. Every colour, material, and particle appearance comes from the active style (`@styles`). A hex code in this folder is a bug — it means one art direction has been baked in, and the switcher (#18) can no longer do its job.

ESLint enforces this rule for string and template literals in `src/render/`.
Components receive the active `Style` from the app and use its material factory;
they do not import a preferred palette directly.

## What lives here

- Isometric camera rig (#11)
- Cutaway building geometry generated from cell data (#12)
- Cell state visuals (#13)
- Flame, smoke, and the smoke column (#14)

## Camera-facing contract

`isometricCamera.ts` is the renderer-facing source of truth for quarter turns. Its
coordinate convention is +X east and +Z south. `getCameraFacing()` returns the
normalized rotation, camera quadrant, yaw, and the two exterior walls on the
camera side of the scene. Camera-dependent geometry should consume
`cameraFacingWalls` instead of inferring direction from Three.js camera vectors.

`IsometricCameraRig` calls `onFacingChange` with the requested target facing at
the start of each smooth Q/E rotation, as well as once on mount.

## Cutaway building contract

`buildingLayout.ts` converts any valid `CellGrid` dimensions into pure instance
transforms. `CutawayBuilding` renders those transforms in one instanced layer
for walls, floors, and roof, plus one cell layer per simulation material. It
hides the two sides named by `cameraFacingWalls` and retains their opposites.

Cell layers expose both `instanceId -> cellId` through `mesh.userData.cellIds`
and `cellId -> { mesh, instanceIndex }` through `CutawayBuildingHandle`. Cell
state rendering (#13) should update those instances rather than introducing one
mesh per cell.

## Budget

< 80 draw calls, < 2000 active particles, 60fps at 1080p on integrated graphics. The harness in #4 makes violations visible.
